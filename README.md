# What I learned
This repository represents a finished sample web application from the course 'Angular: Getting Started' from Pluralsight.

I was building this app while watching the course, coding along with the author. Some of the things I discovered include:
- Basic Angular concepts and building blocks, such as components, modules, dependency injection, interpolation etc.
- How to use the angular CLI to create a new project, generate new modules, guards, components and more, test and deploy the web app.
- I learnt to use pipes and create a custom pipe, one-way and two-way binding, how to use ngIf and ngFor.
- How to nest components and pass data to and from the nested component using @Input and @Output.
- I was introduced to the concept of dependency injection and how to use it in Angular.
- How to send an HTTP request, subscribe to an observable, use lifecycle hooks and handle exceptions if the HTTP request doesn't succeed.
- I learnt how routing works, how to configure routes and tie them to actions, pass parameters to a route and activate a route with code.
- I discovered the guards concept and how to protect a route with a guard.
